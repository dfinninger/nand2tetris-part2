# Nand-to-Tetris (Part 2)

My work for the Nand to Tetris (Part 2) course: https://www.coursera.org/learn/nand2tetris2

Project files have been mirrored into the `nand2tetris/` folder.

## Building

The project uses sbt-assembly to generate a fat Jar.
Run `sbt assembly` then look for the `*-assembly-*` Jar in the target folder.
